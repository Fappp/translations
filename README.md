# translations

All our copy in one repo so that we can translate into other languages. Should cover the whole site.

All files are in [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format.

Currently only English is in here. There's a lot of stuff in code that needs to be pulled into this repo because CROS was lazy during development. Shame on him.

We will work on getting a translation service set up so others can help with other translations soon!
